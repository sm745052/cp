# Hamiltonian Path
Every Node is visited eactly once. \
That means no nodes are repeated, no nodes are left out. \
No edges are repeated(since 2 vertices will be repeated in that case) but edges may be left out. \
Every hamiltonian path is a simple path i.e., no repetition in vertices (and hence edges) in the path. \
Every simple path is a Hamiltonian Path in its restricted domain.\
\
***Hence, note that, sum of all (number of hamiltonian paths in a subset of a graph ending at one node in the subset) in nothing but twice the number of simple paths.***
