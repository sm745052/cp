# applicable for 2 arrays when if an element is present in A, then it is present exactly once in A and also exactly once in B. Similarly for B.
## Note: they would be of equal size and the unique elements would be same in both arrays and no repeating elements in each array.
## Example: permutations
## for each b[i] find where it is present in A. store this in c[i]. Find the LIS of C in nlogn.
